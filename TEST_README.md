Le Royaume is a private French community (filtered entry) on the Discord platform, with the objective of helping each other, discussing and debating on development, graphics and trading. 

We use this GitHub organization for the common projects of our community members, the majority of our projects are open source. Pull requests and issues are mostly written in French but you can contribute in English too.

This is the website of our community, where you can find information about our community, its members and a blog about the different topics we are passionate about. This site is written in JavaScript with Express, EJS and SCSS.
